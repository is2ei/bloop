# bloop `v1.4.0`

Bloop v1.4.0 is the culmination of a lot of work during the past months. While
some users have been benefiting from these features and bug fixes for a while
because Metals has been updating its Bloop version often, these release notes
offer an exhaustive description of all of the changes since v1.3.5.

It is strongly recommended to upgrade to bloop v1.4.0!

## Features

### New installation, `bloopgun` and dropping Python support

Our previous `CLI` was written in Python, based on the Nailgun python CLI. This
CLI required the user to install Python in the machine and had some issues such
as reliability problems and lack of a way of starting the bloop server
automatically in the background.

`bloopgun` is a new Scala-based CLI that replaces the previous Python CLI.
Bloopgun is built on [snailgun] and compiles to GraalVM in supported
architectures (Windows support is not there yet).

This release also changes the installation methods that Bloop provides to
clients. From now on, the recommended way to install bloop is through `coursier
install`, only available in the latest coursier versions. It's recommended you
upgrade to the latest. 

Additional installation resources such as Systemd files or `brew services` are
no longer installed by Bloop. More details about this can be found in [this
ticket](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/issues/1200).

### Shaded launcher and `bloopgun`

To avoid problems downstream, `bloopgun` and the launchers responsible for
starting bloop in the background are shaded to avoid causing dependency issues.

### Fixed numerous problems with compile invalidations

This release fixes some important compile invalidations issue that have popped
up over the course of this past months. These issues could cause
`ClassNotFoundException`s or failed compilations in some corner cases. `v1.4.0`
fixes all known issues in this area, providing a better experience to those
users that have run into these problems.

### Support for Hydra, a parallel Scala compiler

Mirco Dotta has added support for Hydra in Bloop v1.4.0. Hydra is a parallel
Scala compiler, it's created and maintained by [Triplequote]. Triplequote
customers should now be able to use Bloop in their development workflows,
bringing the best of parallel Scala compilation and incremental, fast compilers
by Bloop.

### Experimental support in `sbt-bloop` to offload compilation to Bloop.

Bloop and sbt-bloop support offloading compilation from build tools. This
support added sbt-bloop with the capability of offloading compilation to Bloop,
so that compilations triggered from sbt or build clients such as IntelliJ or
Metals would be shared.

This feature is still experimental because there are some bugs that need to be
addressed. Only people willing to report bugs and help iron out this feature
are welcome to try it out now.

### Improved tracing support via workspace settings

Bloop `v1.4.0` has support for configuring tracing settings at a workspace
level thanks to [Win Wang][wiwa]. You can add these new settings under
`.bloop/bloop.settings.json`. The default tracing settings are:

```
{
  "traceSettings": {
    "serverUrl": "",
    "debugTracing": false,
    "verbose": false,
    "localServiceName": "",
    "traceStartAnnotation": "",
    "traceEndAnnotation": ""
  }
}
```

### Debugging support via DAP

Bloop supports the [Debug Adapter protocol][dap] and exposes it to clients such
as Metals, so that build clients can debug tests or main applications in your
build. Implementation of this feature was a joint effort of many people, lead
by [Marek Å»arnowski][marek].

### Source glob support and changes to the bloop configuration format

Bloop now supports source globs in the bloop configuration file so that build
tools such as Pants or Bazel can represent their targets in terms of Bloop
configuration files. Check the following file for an [up-to-date JSON Schema of
the bloop configuration file](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/docs/assets/bloop-schema.json).

### Runtime performance improvements

Bloop has been tested in large 1M+ codebases over the past months and we have
landed several changes to improve the runtime performance of Bloop in several
key parts of the developer experience. Bloop `v.1.4.0` is faster and more
reliable after these changes.

### Support for concurrent CLI sessions

Despite the fact that Bloop has had support for concurrent BSP and CLI sessions
for a while, Bloop didn't support concurrent CLI sessions until recently (e.g.
`bloop run foo-web` in one terminal, and `bloop test foo-web -o mytest.Bar` in
another one).

### Support for Scala.js 1.0

Bloop v1.4.0 supports the latest Scala.js 1.0 release thanks to [Tim
Nieradzik][tindzk]. This release also includes some linking improvements.

### Export improvements in build tools such as Gradle and `sbt`

We have landed several changes to improve build tool export in both `Gradle`
and `sbt`. To just name a few highlights, `gradle-bloop` supports now Gradle
6.0+ and sbt supports running a project from its project working directory
instead of the sbt build working directory.

### Improved IntelliJ integration

Latest IntelliJ 2020.1.1 has significantly improved BSP and Bloop support, so
using Bloop with IntelliJ becomes easier and more reliable than before.

### Support for global Bloop options

Users can now configure the options that the JVM options the bloop server
should use when starting up in `$HOME/.bloop/bloop.json`. See the online
documentation [here](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/docs/server-reference#global-settings-for-the-server).
